# SilentStream

SilentStream is an extraction of some parts of ActiveSupport's Kernel Reporting Core Extentions around silencing IO streams.

Since July 2014 `silence_stream`, `silence_stderr`, `capture`, `silence`, and `quietly` have been deprecated because they are not thread safe.  See that discussion in the [PR where it all went down](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13392). I rely on them a lot in *single threaded* code, and so I plan to keep them alive.  With the exception of `silence`, which was just an alias of `capture`.

This gem was taken out of Rails but it is *not* Rails dependent.  The extraction was total (**even the tests**!), and this is now a pure Ruby library, which can be used in any Ruby project without encumbrances.

## NOTE

One aspect of what this gem provides can be achieved with the Rails' built-in [`LoggerSilence`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5-2-stable/activesupport/lib/active_support/logger_silence.rb), which is thread safe.  You will have to decide what is right for you!

## Doing a Rails <= 4 to Rails >= 5 Upgrade?

The reason for not keeping `silence` as it was in Rails 4, i.e. an alias of `capture`, is that the just mentioned `LoggerSilence` now uses this term, and it is shipping with Rails 5. I don't want to make this gem incompatible with Rails 5, so you will have to convert Rails <= 4 implementations that utilize `silence` over to `capture` when using this gem.  One further point of difference is this gem does not add the methods to `Kernel` or `Object`.  You can do that if you like via `include`.  By default this gem does not pollute anything, so you will need to `include SilentStream` in any class using these methods.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'silent_stream'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install silent_stream

## Usage

Four standard methods you may be familiar with from ActiveSupports previous implementation are provided:

```
silence_stderr
silence_stream
capture
quietly
```

They are direct replicas, *except* not mixed into `Kernel` or `Object`, so in order to use them you must mix them into your classes or modules.

```
class Bogosity
  include SilentStream # allows use at instance or class level
end
```

In addition there is a `silence_all` method that is a useful wrapper that can be easily instrumented (turned off and on) with an ENV variable switch.

```ruby
class Bogosity
  include SilentStream # allows use at instance or class level

  def silent
    silence_all(true) do
      puts "play that funky music"
      Rails.logger.info "git jiggy with it"
    end
  end
  class << self
    def noise
      silence_all(false) do
        puts "play that funky music"
        Rails.logger.info "git jiggy with it"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And run

```
>> Bogosity.new.silent # has no output
=> nil
>> Bogosity.noise # is noisy
play that funky music
=> nil
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically,
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will
only be introduced with new major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a
dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency 'silent_stream', '~> 1.0'
```
